I have relased a new version 0.1.9 of fribidi with the following major
changes:

    * Changed basic type FriBidiChar to guint32 which corresponds
      to UCS4.

    * Added the missing rule EN,ET=>EN,EN , and thus fixed a major
      bug in the algorithm.

    * Fixed several memory leaks found by Owen Taylor.


Here's the blurb in case someone missed it:

FriBidi is a free BiDi library that should adher closely to the Unicode 
BiDi algorithm.

FriBidi is written in C and should provide a common API that will 
facilitate porting of various software to support BiDirection 
locals.

FriBidi may be found at:

Here is an example of what the library can do, where capital letters
are treated as having Right-To-Left direction.
