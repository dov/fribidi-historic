BiDi algorithms issues:

* Change code to support latest revisions of the unicode technical report.

* Support LRE, RLE, RLO and LRO.

General issues:

* Clean up code

* Optimize binary searches.

* Better documentation

* Write some utility programs.

* Is it worthwile to make the library shared? Comments?

* Write notes and a reference implementation for the following interactions
  with fribidi:

    - Terminal editing with cursor key interaction, e.g. through curses.
      No mouse or cut and paste interaction.

    - Like above (with fixed fonts?) but in an GUI environment where 
      the mouse may be used to position the cursor.

    - Like above but with the ability to do a mouse selection. At least
      in logical mode, possibly in visual mode.

    - Like above but with proportional fonts.

    - Like above with proportional fonts and character attributes.

    - Like above but with kerning between characters.

* Write a description of the needed steps to convert a LTR editor into a
  BiDi aware editor.

* Make interfaces to other scripting languages if there is any interest.

* Consider the implications of a minimal incremental algorithm for
  adding a single character.

* Add handling of precomposed and presentation unicode chars when converting
  to 8 bit encodings (breaking into several chars, or better match)

* Farsi 8bit encoding ISIRI-3342 has the notion of strong typed chars like
  spaces etc (all the range 0x00-0x3f,0x7f is strong typed left-to-right,
  and duplicated in 0x80-0xbf,0xff as a strong typed right-to-left version.
  several chars in the range 0xa0-0xbf have unicode counterparts; but
  others (and all in the range 0x80-0x9f,0xff) have not; so how should that
  be handled when converting to unicode to preserve at best the direction
  information ?
